# systemic-bashit-scripts

I've created a bunch of scripts that provide various aliases & other functionalist for things like git, docker, and other things. Below I've described the scripts that are installed by running the following command.

		git clone git@github.com:adron-orange/systemic-bashit-scripts.git
		cd ~/systemic-bashit-scripts/
		./setup

That command will do the following.
